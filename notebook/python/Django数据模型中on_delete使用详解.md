on_delete属性针对外键ForeignKey

**一、django3.0官方文档介绍：**  

Many-to-one relationships多对一关系  

> To define a many-to-one relationship, use django.db.models.ForeignKey. You
> use it just like any other Field type: by including it as a class attribute
> of your model.
>
> ForeignKey requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is
> related.
